The source code files and Makefile under this directory was used during lectures on 11/18/2022 and 11/21/2022.

Thanks so much for those inputs during the lectures such that I fixed a few major software bugs.

These files should NOT be used for HW#5 or HW#6 directly. You might, however, learn the skills to solve challenges in HWs from the examples provided here. Again, any attempt to directly copy the code into your response to the HWs without understanding the content will likely not lead to an acceptable solution.

If you have any question about the examples, please feel free to ask the instructor.
